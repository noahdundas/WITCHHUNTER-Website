        <h1>WITCHHUNTER.exe</h1>
        <p class="left-align">Maybe you found it on a floppy disk in your parent's attic. Maybe on an old cartridge in a pawn shop.<br>In any case, you've found WITCHHUNTER, or it's found you. At first glance, it's just a relic of a bygone age of video games, one of those old text-based adventure games where you type your inputs into a terminal prompt to move through the story.</p>
        <p class="red">There's something wrong with this game.</p>
        <p>Choose your actions carefully. The pyres are lit. Someone's going to die.</p>
